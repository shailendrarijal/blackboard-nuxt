I have always hated the way non-native Nepali speakers pronounce this word – Yoga –. Let me tell you why. If you take the a sound in ball and consider that as a and then take the ā sound from paragraph, there is a difference between the a sound and ā sound. Taking that into account, this word is written as yoga and it is pronounced as Yoga not as Yogā.

> ***"This article is for those people who want to learn the sounds of Nepali language and to those who think that we are not correctly teaching the sounds to non-native people. IIn this article, I propose a solution to a very common problem."***

## Problem:

If you look at this word in Nepali script: बागमती is written in English script as Bagmati. Now, to a native person, they easily understand how it is pronounced and they will correctly pronounce it as Bāgamati where as a non–native speaker might say it as something like bag-myati. I don’t blame them because we have not made it simple and have not given them a manual to understand how things are pronounced. I also dont blame them because we have added confusion when converting Nepali script to English. In this very example, we should not be overworking the a in all places with all different sounds.

## Solution:

If you want to make the learning of Nepali language hassle-free, if you don’t want to complicate an easy language, if you want to promote the language, then we must make it easy to understand to non-native people and create a manual for them. We need to have consistency on how we write Nepali words in english script. We need to pertain to that method in order to preserve the integrity of the language. We cannot expect people to understand that one a stands for this sound and another a stands for this sound when there are different sounds in Nepali language. On top of that, when the sound system of bārhakharī already exists. It might take sometime to get a hang of it, but I believe that once we get a hang of it, we will be able to take our language to the top. In this article, lets dive into this solution to make Nepali learning easy.

## A quick overview of Nepali script:

Nepali language uses Devnāgarī script but does not include everything that Devnāgarī script has to offer. There are 12 distinct vowel sounds which already includes dipthongs. There are 36 peculiar consonants with some aspirated, some unaspirated and nasal consonants. All of these consonants take on the first vowel in its pure form. These consonants combined with vowels make peculiar sound and this system is known as Bāhrakhari. Sometimes, consonant could be vowel-stripped and those kind of consonants are called Halanta where the consonant is pronounced in its sound without a vowel. Those consonants sometimes combine with another pure consonant or Halanta consonant to create conjunct sounds. On top of these vowels and consonants, there are two diacritics which add to the nasal sounds and they are: Chandrabindu (ã - अँ) and Shirbindu (aṃ - अं). Spend some time to understand and learn these and you will be able to understand the script easily. 

## Existing problem when writing Nepali with English alphabets:

At the moment, there is increase in technology and with increasing use of technology, more and more people are writing in Nepali language using English letters. When writing in Nepali script itself, there is no issue but when using English letters to write Nepali, the sounds are intertangled, the words become confusing and the language starts losing its value. Another problem is that not all consonants have a similar sound in English like the sound (t - त्). However, when writing the Nepali words that have this letter, English letter ‘t’ is used so unless it is properly configured and taught to non native people, they will not be able to pronounce it properly. So, here is a proposed solution to use these characters and make them consistent everywhere. Although the names cannot be changed, we can use this phonetic symbols to make people understand the sounds of Nepali language. That would mean, we can write Bāgamati on top of Bagmati to let people know how it is correctly pronounced. That means we can finally let people know that it is not pronounced Yogā but is actually Yoga. What’s the difference? Let’s look at it here:

### Notes for reading the sounds:

* The English alphabet is how we should be writing our Nepali letters when we are writing Nepali using English letters.
* The Nepali letters are the actual letters
* Where possible, I have tried to provided a similar sound for the letters
* For the consonants, I have provided the Halanta sound meaning those consonants are not with the default a sound. Sound k would be /book/ whereas ka would be /copy/. When reading the consonants, you will find that by default it is written with the added a vowel sound. But, here to provide clarity, I have used the Halanta sound.

## Bāhrakhari:

There are 12 vowels in Nepali script.  

1. a - अ - /as in ball/:
2. ā - आ - /as in are/
3. i - इ - /as in ship/
4. ī - ई - /as in sheep/
5. u - उ - /as in put/
6. ū - ऊ - /as in mood/
7. ṛ - ऋ - /as in profound/
8. e - ए - /as in pen/
9. ai - ऐ - /as in bonsai/
10. o - ओ - /as in bone/
11. au - औ - /as in bowl/
12. aṃ - अं - /as in umpire/
13. ã - अँ - /as in —- /
14. aḥ - अः - /as in —- /

There are 36 consonants in Nepali script. Combining with the vowel, there would be 12 sounds for each of these consonants. This is called Bāhrakhari system:

## Disclaimer:

I am writing this article not as a Nepali language scholar, but as a user who thinks that there has been a huge inconsistency in the Romanized version of Nepali words. I am proposing this solution as a solution to that problem, as an user. If someone has a better solution than this and comes forward with that solution, I would gladly accept that. Please understand that the only motives behind this proposal is to bring consistency, to preserve the integrity of Nepali alphabets and their usages and correctly transform the Nepali alphabets to english letters.

## Modifications:

I have used many characters from IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration) and have modified a few like the letter च् with c instead of ch. This way, we can reduce two characters: c for च् and ch for छ् would mean, we remove the need of an extra h in both these letters. Similarly, using v for भ् instead of bh. The same reason to remove an extra h. Another one is using f for फ् instead of ph.
