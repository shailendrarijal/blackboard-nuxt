Did you know that in the Nepali language, you have a separate name for each of your relations? So, in a family function, you can call out that specific person without even calling their name. Let's look at the names for relations in the Nepali language. You will find the relation in English and the pronunciation of the relation in Nepali along with the relation name in Nepali script.

On top of these names, there are also different names to differentiate based on the hierarchy. Like if I have three elder brothers, then the eldest brother is thulo daai, and then maailo daai, and then kaanchho daai. Following are the hierarchy names:



1. Ṭhulo / ठूलाे: The eldest
2. Māilo / माइलाे: 2nd eldest
3. Sāilo / साइलाे: 3rd eldest
4. Kāilo / काइलाे: 4th eldest
5. Ṭhāilo / ठाइलाे: 5th eldest
6. Kānchho / कान्छाे: youngest



For females, it goes like this:

1. Ṭhulī / ठूली: The eldest
2. Māilī / माइली: 2nd eldest
3. Sāilī / साइली: 3rd eldest
4. Kāilī / काइली: 4th eldest
5. Ṭhāilī / ठाइली: 5th eldest
6. Kānchhī / कान्छी: youngest

This applies to all the relations. I understand that there might be some confusion in the names and not all the names are completely unique like `jwāi` could be used for daughter's husband, sister's husband. Also, something to notice is that modernization has had an effect on many names and these names are not completely used. Like, instead of saying `kākā` and `kākī` to the father's younger brother and his wife, we call them uncle and aunty now.



But, it is amazing that there exists this list. Who knows, but I wonder, could it be a reason why we have so many closed ones in the Nepali community.
