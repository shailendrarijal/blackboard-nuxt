> #### You don't want to be saying, 'Press that key left to the number 1 key.' You want to be saying, 'Press the tick key'.

Imagine you are pair programming with your buddy. You want them to use template literals. But you don't know what that symbol is. It's not quotes or double quotes. You have been using it a lot but you don't know the name for it. You gotta say, the one left to the number 1 key. But, if you know the name of the key, you can easily say, 'tick key' and that saves time for you and your pair.

Let's look at the common names for the commonly used keyboard keys:

`~` = Tilde

`` ` `` = Backtick

`|` = Pipe

`{` = Open curly brace

`}` = Closed curly brace

`/` = Slash

`\` = Backslash

`:` = Colon

`;` = Semicolon

`'` = Single quote

`"` = Double quotes

`<` = Less than

`>` = Greater than

`_` = Underscore

`-` = Hyphen

`*` = Asterisk

`&` = Ampersand

`^` = Caret

`@` = At

`#` = Hash

`$` = Dollar

`!` = Exclamation
